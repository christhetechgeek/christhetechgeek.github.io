🏛️ Kingdom of Technical Wealth
christhetechgeek.github.io
Mission Statement: To provide a direct path to technical mastery through Surgical Software Utility, Human-First Design, and Mission-Critical Documentation. This repository is not a collection of toys; it is a suite of logically validated instruments for AI, Hardware, Networking, and UX engineering.

🏗️ The Six Pillars of Architecture
The Kingdom is divided into six logical vaults, each containing three tiers of software utility:
Small Tier: Precision calculators and efficiency logic.
Medium Tier: Infrastructure diagnostics and parsing logic.
Large Tier: Architectural orchestration and visual design systems.

🔮 1. The Oracle (AI & Logic)
Logic for the Agentic Era.
Prompt Surgical Optimizer [Small]: Strips conversational noise from LLM inputs and injects strict logical constraints for high-precision output.
Context Density Calculator [Medium]: Analyzes technical files to predict token saturation across GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini context windows.
Agentic Workflow Designer [Large]: A visual workspace for mapping AI agent sequences with mandatory "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) validation gates.

🏟️ 2. The Arena (Gaming & Execution)
Utility for High-Performance Environments.
Frame-Time Stability Checker [Small]: Analyzes the mathematical parity between FPS and Refresh Rate (Hz) to identify micro-stuttering and judder.
Competitive Sensitivity Mapper [Medium]: Synchronizes muscle memory by converting sensitivity ratios across different game engines (Source, Unreal, etc.).
Hardware Bottleneck Simulation [Large]: Predicts throughput inefficiencies between CPU and GPU pairings based on resolution scaling (1080p to 4K).

🛡️ 3. The Armory (Hardware & Diagnostics)
Logic for the Physical Machine.
PSU Wattage Estimator [Small]: Calculates total system TDP and recommends power supply overhead for optimal efficiency curves.
Thermal Throttling Diagnostic [Medium]: Correlates temperature deltas with clock speed to confirm if a system has hit its "Thermal Wall."
Build-a-Rig Compatibility Engine [Large]: An architectural auditor that verifies socket parity, RAM clearance, and physical chassis dimensions.

🔒 4. The Vault (Technical Documentation)
The Repository of Network Knowledge.
IP Subnet Calculator [Small]: Precision CIDR and subnet mask logic to determine usable host ranges in enterprise networking.
Port Security Checklist [Medium]: A security audit frame for verifying ingress points against standard security protocols (SSH, FTP, HTTP).
Network Topology Mapper [Large]: A visual designer for documenting large-scale infrastructure, from edge gateways to data clusters.

⚒️ 5. The Forge (Software Development)
Accelerating the Build Process.
CSS Filter Generator [Small]: Generates surgical CSS code for visual effects (blur, saturate, hue) with real-time logic validation.
Regex Pattern Tester [Medium]: A testing environment for regular expressions with real-time highlighting and syntax error reporting.
Full-Stack Boilerplate Forge [Large]: Generates clean, human-first directory structures and starter logic for various development stacks.

🧪 6. The Foundry (Design & UX)
Shaping the Human Experience.
UX Color Contrast Validator [Small]: Verifies color logic against WCAG 2.1 standards to ensure UI accessibility across the visual spectrum.
AX Experience Audit Tool [Medium]: Measures the friction, transparency, and agency of AI-driven workflows.
Human-First Journey Architect [Large]: Maps user journeys specifically to define the hand-off points between automated agents and human technicians.
